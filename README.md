# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using ten different machine learning models. The goal is to compare the performance of these models and determine which one yields the best results. The dataset used is a CSV file containing various health metrics relevant to heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Repository only and contains various health-related features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. The target variable indicates whether the individual has heart disease.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models were implemented and compared:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Naive Bayes
7. Gradient Boosting
8. AdaBoost
9. XGBoost
10. Neural Network

Each model was trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
    cd heart-disease-prediction
    ```

2. Place the dataset CSV file in the project directory.

3. Run the main script in Jupiter notebook

4. The results for each model, including performance metrics and comparisons, will be displayed in the console.

## Results

After comparing all the models, you will get the best performing model
